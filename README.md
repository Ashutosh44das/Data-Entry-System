# Simple Data Entry System using Tkinter and Openpyxl

This Python script implements a basic data entry form using Tkinter for the GUI and Openpyxl for handling Excel files. It allows users to enter details such as name, contact information, age, gender, and address, which are then saved to an Excel spreadsheet (`Backend_data.xlsx`).

## Features
- GUI created with Tkinter for user-friendly data input.
- Data validation and storage in an Excel file (`Backend_data.xlsx`).
- Includes options to submit data, clear fields, and exit the application.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)
- Openpyxl library (`pip install openpyxl`)

## How to Use
1. Ensure Python and the required libraries are installed.
2. Run the script (`data_entry_form.py`).
3. Fill out the entry form with the required details.
4. Click **Submit** to save the data to `Backend_data.xlsx`.
5. Click **Clear** to reset the form fields.
6. Click **Exit** to close the application.

## Notes
- The Excel file (`Backend_data.xlsx`) will be created automatically if it doesn't exist.
- Make sure to have write permissions for the directory where the script is located to save the Excel file.

Feel free to modify and adapt the code as needed for your projects!
